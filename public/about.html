    SAFE is an anonymous feedback system for students to leave questions and comments for the computer science department.
    It allows the department to view feedback given by anonymous users, and provides a way for department faculty to respond to feedback without revealing the identities of the students.
    Since students are not required to log in to the schools network to leave feedback, and SAFE does not require an account, no identifying information is stored. Students can choose to receive a one time
    code via email if they would like a response to a question which is why we can't guarantee SAFE is 100% anonymous, but if students decide to opt out of that option it is as anonymous as we could make it (which is still not 100%). Alternatively,
    students can choose to receive the one time code by having it displayed on the screen once they have submitted the question/feedback which will not require an email address.
