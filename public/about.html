          >SAFE is a secure feedback platform designed to empower students to
          openly express their questions and comments anonymously for the
          computer science department chair in Portland State University.
          <br /><br />

          It offers an invaluable method for students to provide honest
          feedback, shedding light on areas where improvement is needed and
          offering suggestions to enhance the support provided for their
          success. <br /><br />

          Significantly, SAFE exudes a user-centric approach by relieving
          students from the obligation to log in or create an account, thereby
          guaranteeing the utmost protection of their privacy as no identifying
          information is stored.</span
