  <p class = "safemessage">
    <span>SAFE is an anonymous feedback system for students to leave questions and comments for the computer science department chair to review. It gives students an opportunity to share honest feedback with the department and provide insight on areas that it can improve or provide students the tools they need to succeed. Since students are not required to log in to the schools network to leave feedback, and SAFE does not require an account, no identifying information is stored. </span>
