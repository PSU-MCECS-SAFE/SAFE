          >SAFE is a secure feedback platform designed to empower students to
          openly express their questions, comments and concerns anonymously for
          the Computer Science Department Chair at Portland State University.
          <br /><br />

          SAFE offers an invaluable method for students to provide honest
          feedback, shedding light on areas where improvement is needed, or
          suggestions to enhance the support mechanisms that are
          offered to them. <br /><br />

          SAFE asserts a user-centric approach by relieving students from the
          obligation to log in or create an account, thereby assuring the utmost
          protection of their privacy such that no identifying information is
          stored.</span
