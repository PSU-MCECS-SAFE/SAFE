/* This defines the App.tsx layout, which is different from index.css
    If you're not familiar with css, just know that the imports in a file
    will happen top down, that is:

    import "./oldCSS.css"
    import "./newCSS.css"
    import "./newestCSS.css"

    newCSS.css will override oldCSS.css and newestCSS.css will override both
